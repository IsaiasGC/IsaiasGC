# Hello!

I am a Fullstack Developer with a strong backend focus and over 4 years of professional experience. I build scalable, maintainable software using clean code principles and robust architectural patterns.

👨‍💻 Currently, I work at [OCC](https://www.occ.com.mx) in a hybrid role, where I contribute to the architecture and development of a microservices-based platform. Our stack includes Golang, Python, Docker, Kubernetes, Kafka, and AWS Cloud. I focus on designing and maintaining backend services that support one of Mexico’s leading job platforms.

⚙️ One of my key achievements has been significantly reducing the processing time of high-volume batch jobs (using AWS Batch), which handle critical operations such as updating external databases and refining user data for personalized, recurring notifications—leading to improved performance and operational efficiency.

🛠️ I am experienced in building scalable, containerized systems using Docker and Kubernetes. I’m passionate about clean architecture, distributed systems, and delivering reliable, high-impact solutions that serve both users and the business effectively.

🚀 A fast learner and team-oriented professional, I thrive on solving complex problems and continuously seek opportunities to grow and improve as a developer and architect.
